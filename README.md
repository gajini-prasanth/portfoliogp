ðŸŒ± About Me
I'm GAJINI, a driven engineering student at Erode Sengunthar Engineering College,on track to graduate in 2027. 
My passion lies in bridging technology with real-world impactâ€”whether it's developing tamper-proof mobility systems or deploying secure cloud-connected devices to serve rural communities.
I specialize in programming (Java, Python, C), cloud platforms like Google App Engine, and database modeling across document, graph, and relational schemas.
I believe innovation should serve people.
Thatâ€™s why I focus on scalable safety ecosystems, agri-tech prototypes, and startup pitches with public trust and compliance at the core. 
Iâ€™m not just hands-on with codeâ€”Iâ€™m strategic with storytelling, proposal writing, and visual branding that brings technical ideas to life.
